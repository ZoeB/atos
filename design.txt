Load a font file (8x8x64) and store it in memory

For each char in message:
	Read that letter from the font in memory

	For each column:
		For each row:
			Work out whether it's on or off
			Set the oscillators on or off, correspondingly
		Sum the oscillators (leave headroom)
		Keep oscillating/summing for a pixel width's amount of time
		Write it to a .wav or, failing that, .pcm file as you're going

The 8-pixel-row charsets, a standard byte tall, afford me the opportunity to not merely split this up into different functions, but different pipable programs.  So I could do this:

* Write a program to convert the charset to from PETSCII to ASCII order
* Write a program to translate ASCII text into byte-long columns
* Write a program to translate that into ASCII art, vertical or horizontal, for testing purposes and bonus figlet clonage
* Write a program to translate the binary columns into PCM data

Or I could do this:

* Write an ASCII-to-PETSCII converter
* Write a program to translate PETSCII into byte-long columns (really, it's charset agnostic, it just goes by the byte numbers to look up)
[The last two are the same.]

The latter seems more generally useful for a C64-tinkerer such as myself.
