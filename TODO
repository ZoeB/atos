For each column:
	For each row:
		Work out whether it's on or off
		Set the oscillators on or off, correspondingly
	Sum the oscillators (leave headroom)
	Keep oscillating/summing for a pixel width's amount of time
	Write it to a .pcm file as you're going

The 8-pixel-row charsets, a standard byte tall, afford me the opportunity to not merely split this up into different functions, but different pipable programs:

* Write an ASCII-to-PETSCII converter [DONE]
* Write a program to translate chars into byte-long columns [DONE]
* Write a program to translate that into ASCII art, vertical [DONE] or horizontal [TODO], for testing purposes and bonus figlet clonage
* Write a program to translate the binary columns into PCM data [TODO]
