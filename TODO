atos (ASCII to sine waves / ASCII to sound)

* Take ASCII string or stdin as input
* Output five (at first) sine waves, one per row of rasterised text
* Load arbitrary 8x8 font files (SEUCK format, so I already have an editor)
* Eventually allow custom frequencies (16kHz, 17, 18, 19, and 20 should be fine to start wtih)
